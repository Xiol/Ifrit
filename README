C program to send data from a 1Wire temperature sensor on a RaspberryPi to statsd.

Requires an owserver to be running on the RaspberryPi.

Edit ifrit.h to change settings, then:
    make
    ./ifrit

I don't do C - this may blow up.

statsd.{c,h} are from https://github.com/kjagiello/statsd-c-client
